# ðŸŽ“ Project 2: High School Graduation Rate Analysis

>**This project examines how various social factors influence high school graduation rates across 50 U.S. states from 2011 to 2017.**

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project was conducted in collaboration with Ethan Gertsch and Johnny Lam. My role in the project involved data short sampling, analysis by data modeling **ANOVA** and **linear regression**, and **facet plot** to visualize high school graduation rates across the 50 states, along with variables that may negatively impact graduation rates.


Data Pedigree and Terms of Service
The data for this research is primarily gathered from the National Center for Educational Statistics. 
The NCES is part of the United States Department of Education and was created to be the principal organization to collect, analyze, and publish US education statistics.
Within the NCES, a separate arm called the Administrative Data Division collects data by surveying schools across the United States. 
The datasets used in this research are from secondary schools and adhere to strict guidelines of data collection. 
The primary variables being analyzed among high schoolers are graduation rates, violence on school property, bullying, and alcohol use.
As all data is the product of government-collected federally funded research, 
the terms of service are regulated by the Freedom of Information Act which provides individuals with the right to access the information. 
Thus there are no concerns for this dataâ€™s use in a school research project.
