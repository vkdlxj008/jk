## üîç Key Findings

### 1. üö¨ Smoking Impact Analysis
**SQL Query Used:**
```sql
-- Basic statistics with GROUP BY and aggregation functions
SELECT smoker, COUNT(*) AS People, ROUND(AVG(charges), 2) AS avg_premium,
       ROUND(STDDEV(charges), 2) AS standard_deviation
FROM insurance_data GROUP BY smoker;

-- Subquery calculation for precise difference
SELECT ROUND((SELECT AVG(charges) FROM insurance_data WHERE smoker = 'yes') - 
             (SELECT AVG(charges) FROM insurance_data WHERE smoker = 'no'), 2) AS difference;
```

**SQL Results:**
- Smokers: $32,050.23 average premium (274 people)
- Non-smokers: $8,434.27 average premium (1,064 people)
- **Difference**: $23,615.96 (280% increase for smokers)

**Key Insights:**
- Smoking represents the single most significant risk factor in insurance pricing
- The premium difference of nearly $24,000 annually demonstrates the substantial health risks associated with smoking
- Only 20.48% of the population smokes, yet they represent the highest cost segment
- Standard deviation for smokers ($11,520.47) is nearly double that of non-smokers ($5,990.96), indicating higher variability in smoking-related health costs

### 2. üåç Regional Analysis
**SQL Query Used:**
```sql
-- Regional statistics with conditional aggregation
SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS people, ROUND(AVG(charges), 2) AS avg_premium,
       SUM(CASE WHEN smoker = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS smoker_count,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN smoker = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS smoker_rate
FROM insurance_data GROUP BY region ORDER BY avg_premium DESC;
```

**SQL Results:**
| Region | People Count | Avg Premium | Smoker Rate |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Southeast | 364 | $14,735.41 | 25.00% |
| Northeast | 324 | $13,406.38 | 20.68% |
| Northwest | 325 | $12,417.58 | 17.85% |
| Southwest | 325 | $12,346.94 | 17.85% |

**Key Insights:**
- Southeast region shows highest average premiums ($14,735.41) correlating with highest smoking rate (25%)
- Southwest region has lowest premiums ($12,346.94) with lowest smoking rate (17.85%)
- Clear correlation between regional smoking rates and insurance costs discovered through CASE WHEN aggregation
- Regional premium differences of up to $2,388 suggest significant geographic risk factors

### 3. ‚öñÔ∏è BMI Category Analysis
**SQL Query Used:**
```sql
-- BMI categorization using nested CASE WHEN statements
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN bmi < 18.5 THEN 'Underweight (<18.5)'
         WHEN bmi >= 18.5 AND bmi < 25 THEN 'Normal (18.5-24.9)'
         WHEN bmi >= 25 AND bmi < 30 THEN 'Overweight (25-29.9)'
         WHEN bmi >= 30 THEN 'Obese (‚â•30)'
    END AS BMI_category,
    COUNT(*) AS people_count, ROUND(AVG(charges), 2) AS average_premium
FROM insurance_data GROUP BY [CASE statement] ORDER BY average_premium DESC;
```

**SQL Results:**
| BMI Category | People Count | Avg Premium | Avg BMI |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Obese (‚â•30) | 707 | $15,552.34 | 35.27 |
| Overweight (25-29.9) | 386 | $10,987.51 | 27.60 |

SELECT children, 
       CASE WHEN age < 30 THEN '20s' WHEN age >= 30 AND age < 40 THEN '30s'
            WHEN age >= 40 AND age < 50 THEN '40s' ELSE '50s and above' END AS age_group,
       COUNT(*) AS people_count, ROUND(AVG(charges), 2) AS average_premium
FROM insurance_data GROUP BY children, [age_group] ORDER BY children, age_group;
```

**SQL Results - Children Impact Analysis:**
- 0 children: $12,365.98 (574 people)
- 1 child: $12,731.17 (324 people)  
- 2 children: $15,073.56 (240 people)
- 3 children: $15,355.32 (157 people)
- 4+ children: Lower premiums due to small sample sizes

**Key Insights:**
- Having 2+ children correlates with 20%+ higher premiums
- Families with 2-3 children show highest insurance costs through systematic age-group cross-analysis
- Age groups in 50s+ consistently show higher premiums across all child categories
- 43% of population has no children, representing lower-risk segment identified through demographic segmentation

## üîß Data Validation & Advanced SQL Analysis

### üî• **High-Risk Group Identification using UNION:**
**SQL Query Used:**
```sql
-- Advanced segmentation using UNION ALL for comparative analysis
SELECT 'High Risk Group' AS group_type, COUNT(*) AS people_count, 
       ROUND(AVG(charges), 2) AS average_premium
FROM insurance_data WHERE smoker = 'yes' AND bmi >= 30
UNION ALL
SELECT 'General Group', COUNT(*), ROUND(AVG(charges), 2)
FROM insurance_data WHERE smoker = 'no' AND bmi < 30;
```

**Results:**
- **High Risk Group** (Obese Smokers): 145 people, $41,557.99 average premium
- **General Population**: 502 people, $7,977.03 average premium  
- **Risk Multiplier**: 5.2x higher premiums for high-risk individuals

### üìä **BMI-Smoking Interaction using Cross-Tabulation:**

SELECT [BMI_category], smoker, COUNT(*) AS people_count, 
       ROUND(AVG(charges), 2) AS average_premium
FROM insurance_data 
GROUP BY [BMI_category], smoker ORDER BY BMI_category, smoker;
```

| BMI Category | Smoking Status | Count | Average Premium |

## üî¨ Technical SQL Implementation Notes

### Advanced SQL Techniques Utilized

**1. Conditional Aggregation with CASE WHEN:**
```sql
SUM(CASE WHEN smoker = 'yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS smoker_count
-- Counts specific conditions within GROUP BY without subqueries
```

**2. Subquery Calculations for Precise Metrics:**
```sql
SELECT ROUND(
    (SELECT AVG(charges) FROM insurance_data WHERE smoker = 'yes') - 
    (SELECT AVG(charges) FROM insurance_data WHERE smoker = 'no'), 2
) AS difference;
-- Ensures exact calculation without JOIN complexity
```

**3. Window Functions for Ranking Analysis:**
```sql
PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY charges DESC) AS percentile_rank
-- Identifies top performers without multiple passes through data
```

**4. Multi-Level Categorization:**
```sql
CASE WHEN bmi < 18.5 THEN 'Underweight (<18.5)'
     WHEN bmi >= 18.5 AND bmi < 25 THEN 'Normal (18.5-24.9)'
     WHEN bmi >= 25 AND bmi < 30 THEN 'Overweight (25-29.9)'
     ELSE 'Obese (‚â•30)' END
-- Creates meaningful business categories from continuous data
```

**5. UNION ALL for Comparative Segmentation:**
```sql
SELECT 'High Risk' AS segment, COUNT(*), AVG(charges)
FROM insurance_data WHERE smoker = 'yes' AND bmi >= 30
UNION ALL  
SELECT 'General', COUNT(*), AVG(charges)
FROM insurance_data WHERE smoker = 'no' AND bmi < 30;
-- Combines different population segments for direct comparison
```
