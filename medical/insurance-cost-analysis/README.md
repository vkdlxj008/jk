## 📈 Key Highlights
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns in insurance costs.
- Compared BMI and insurance charges across regions (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest).
- Identified Southeast region as having the highest BMI and insurance costs.
- Created visual dashboards for clear communication of insights.

## 🔜 Future Work
- Add more CSV datasets to enrich the analysis.
- Extend SQL scripts to integrate new data.
- Update visualizations and insights accordingly.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Use the SQL scripts in the `sql/` folder to set up and query the database.
2. Review CSV outputs in the `results/` folder.
3. Open the dashboards and images in `visuals/` for visual analysis.
4. Read detailed insights in the `insights/` markdown files.
