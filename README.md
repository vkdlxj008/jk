## 🏥 Project 1: Insurance Cost Analysis  
**Date**: August 2024  
**Tools**: Tableau, Excel,SQL

### 🔍 Overview  
This project analyzes the impact of smoking, BMI, and region on healthcare insurance costs across four U.S. regions.

### 📌 Key Insights  
- **Smoking** is the **strongest cost driver**, increasing insurance charges by **300%+**.  
- The **Southeast region** shows the **highest average charges (₩12,142)** and BMI.  
- A **positive trend** exists between BMI and insurance charges.  
- Demographic breakdown (sex + smoker status) reveals significant differences in average cost.

### 📈 Visualizations  
- Bar + line chart comparing **BMI & Charges by region**  
- Scatter plot showing **BMI vs. Charges** correlation  
- Demographic table for **Sex & Smoking status**  
- Bar chart for **average charge by smoker status**

## 🎓 Project 2: High School Graduation Rate Analysis  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Tools**: R, ggplot2  

### 🔍 Overview  
This project examines how various social factors influence high school graduation rates across 50 U.S. states from 2011 to 2017.

### 📌 Key Insights  
- **Alcohol use** has a statistically significant negative effect on graduation rates (**p = 0.0106**).  
- **Weapon presence in schools** also shows a near-significant impact (**p = 0.0573**).  
- Despite consistent graduation rate increases nationwide, bullying and cyberbullying persist over time.

### 📈 Visualizations  
- Faceted time-series plots by state, showing:  
  - Graduation Rate (ACGR)  
  - Alcohol use, bullying, cyberbullying, and weapon reporting

## 🕵️ Project 3: COVID-19 and Crime Rate Analysis  
**Date**: April 2024  
**Tools**: R, ggplot2  

### 🔍 Overview  
This project investigates changes in local crime rates **before, during, and after** the COVID-19 pandemic using kernel density estimation.

### 📌 Key Insights  
- **Crime density significantly dropped** during the pandemic period.  
- Post-pandemic crime remained **lower than pre-pandemic levels**, suggesting a lasting behavioral or policy effect.
